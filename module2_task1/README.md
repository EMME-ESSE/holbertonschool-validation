Sorry about that. Here's an updated version of the README.md file:

# Project Name

This project provides a set of commands to build and manage a website with Hugo. The website can be created, posts can be added, the site can be cleaned up, and the code can be linted.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure the following prerequisites are met:
- Golang should be installed in the environment where the application will be built and run.
- Basic understanding of Makefile and command-line interface.

## Project Lifecycle

The following commands are available:

### Build
Command to compile the source code of the application to a binary named `awesome-api` using the command `go build`.

```bash
make build
```

### Run
Command to run the application in the background by executing the binary `awesome-api` and write logs into a file named `awesome-api.log` using the command `./awesome-api >./awesome-api.log 2>&1 &`.

```bash
make run
```

### Stop
Command to stop the application using the command `kill XXXXX` where XXXXX is the Process ID of the application.

```bash
make stop
```

### Clean
Command to stop the application and delete the binary `awesome-api` and the log file `awesome-api.log`.

```bash
make clean
```

### Test
Command to test the application to ensure that it behaves as expected.

```bash
make test
```

### Lint
Command to run the application through lint to check for errors.

```bash
make lint
```

### Help
Command to print a list of all the goals with a sentence each.

```bash
make help
```

## Requirements

- A Makefile should be present and valid.
- The binary `awesome-api` must NOT exist at the beginning, in the source code.
- The goals `build`, `run`, `stop`, `clean`, `test`, `lint`, and `help` should be implemented and mapped to the lifecycle stages of the same name.
- The `README.md` file should exist.

## Usage
To use this project, simply clone the repository and run the desired command using `make` in the project directory.
